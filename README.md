# SPRING BASICS COLLECTION

This is a collection of Spring-based Java projects, using Maven. It's meant as an educational showcase of the different combinations of technologies we can find within the larger Spring ecosystem.

The functionality of these projects is basic by nature, but no so much that it's unusable as a first building block for anyonw trying to understand these technologies and trying to figure out how to implement them in their own projects.

The collection contains the following:
- `spring-cli-jdbc`: CLI java application, using JDBC DAOs, on Spring (non-boot)
- `spring-cli-jpa`: CLI java application, using JPA repos, on Spring (non-boot)
- `spring-gui-jdbc`: GUI java application, using JDBC DAOs, on Spring (non-boot)
- `spring-gui-jpa`: GUI java application, using JPA repos, on Spring (non-boot)
- `boot-cli-jpa`: CLI java application, using JPA repos, on Spring Boot
- `boot-gui-jpa`: GUI java application, using JPA repos, on Spring Boot


All databases use file-based H2 backends.
All GUI apps use Swing.
